# Dari_Sentiment_Analysis

  This project uses a machine learning-based methods to deal with barriers in the text generated by the user. Unfortunately, there is still insufficient research into the misuse of machine learning approaches for classifying / clustering Dari text.
Besides, Dari text analysis suffers from a lack of resources: Specifically from datasets and text manipulation tools.

One of the most important portions is; that the project provides a Facebook page dataset for sentiment analysis.

Inside this project, plus a directory (called Datasets)and one file which is included four Machine Learning models which are GridSearchCV, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SGD Classification;

Why this project is important?
Furthermore, using different Machine Learning models, it Visualizes the relationship between features. which is included ROC, Precision_Recall_Curve, and learning curve:
